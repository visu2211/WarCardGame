# WarCardGame
This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic card game "War." The game is played between two players using a standard 52-card deck. Each player draws a card from their deck, and the player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards. The game continues until one player has all the cards or a predefined number of rounds have been played.
